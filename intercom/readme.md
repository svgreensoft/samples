Two tasks:
===================================

FLATTEN ARRAY:  Write a function that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] â†’ [1,2,3,4].

CALCULATE DISTANCE: We have some customer records in a text file (customers.json) -- one customer per line, JSON-encoded. We want to invite any customer within 100km of our City office for some food and drinks on us. Write a program that will read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending).

- You can use the first formula from this Wikipedia article to calculate distance. Don't forget, you'll need to convert degrees to radians. The GPS coordinates for our City office are 53.3381985, -6.2592576.
